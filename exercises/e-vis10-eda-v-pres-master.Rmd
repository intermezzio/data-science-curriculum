# Two Levels of Quality
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

> An *EDA quality graph* is meant to help *you* understand
> A *presentation quality graph* is meant to help *someone else* understand

## Producing an EDA quality graph
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

- The point is *not* to make a single EDA quality graph; rather it is to quickly make *many graphs* to facilitate your understanding of the data.

## Producing a presentation quality graph
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In order to *help* someone understand, you must have a clear idea of *what* you want them to understand. Put differently, you must have a clear *message* in mind.
