# Variability

## The Cause-Source Quadrants

The *cause-source quadrants* organize variability into four distinct categories. Last time, we learned about the *source* axis. Today, we're going to focus on the *cause* axis.

## Chance vs Assignable Cause

# Hunting Assignable Causes

## Control Charts - Observing a process

## Comparing Groups - A planned experiment

# Treating Assignable Causes



If we decide there are no remaining assignable causes, we should then treat the remaining chance causes appropriately. Remember that we discussed how to do this in `e-model06-source`.
